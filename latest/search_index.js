    "text": "From (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation]:The state equation, given by the first law of thermodynamics (i.e. conservation of energy), is written in the following form (assuming no mass transfer or radiation). This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize which property (e.g. c_p or rho) influences which term.rho c_pfrac partial Tpartial t-nabla cdot left(knabla Tright)=dot q_Vwhere dotq_V is the volumetric heat source."
