    "text": "The heat equation is a parabolic partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. The state equation, given by the first law of thermodynamics (i.e. conservation of energy), is written in the following form (assuming no mass transfer or radiation). This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize which property (e.g. c_p or rho) influences which term. State equations isrho c_pfracpartial Tpartial t-nablacdotleft(knabla Tright)=dotq_Vwhere dotq_V is the volumetric heat source."
