# Introduction

This package extends JuliaFEM functionalities to solve heat transfer problems.

# Theory

From (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation]:

The state equation, given by the first law of thermodynamics (i.e. conservation
of energy), is written in the following form (assuming no mass transfer or
radiation). This form is more general and particularly useful to recognize
which property (e.g. ``c_p`` or ``\rho``) influences which term.

```math
\rho c_{p}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial t}}-\nabla \cdot \left(k\nabla T\right)={\dot {q}}_{V}},
```
where ``\dot{q}_{V}`` is the volumetric heat source.
